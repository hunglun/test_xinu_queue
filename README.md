This little test code is an exercise to understand, customize and use the xinu code for 
embedded application. 

I am reading through the textbook Operating System Design: The Xinu Approach. 

By writing some test code for some os functionality I just read in the textbook, this exercise forces me to understand the text enough to extract a portion of os code of my own interest, remove irrelevant code, compile it on my test platform and run tests to verify its functionality.

It is a joyful and fulfilling exercise.
